User navigates to a web page via the browser.

This triggers an html protocol event over the network that causes the server to return the content of the requested page back to the client browser.

The browser parses the html and renders it to the window line by line until javascript (either inline or as a remote resource) is referenced.  Html processing is halted until the script is parsed.

Presentation level details are applied to the content of the html when CSS resources are encountered either inline or as <link> tags.
