JavaScript may be referenced as an external resource to a web page via a <script> tag with a 'src' attribute that resolves the location of the js file on the server.

For example:

<html>
<head>
   <script type="text/javascript" src="js/myscript.js"></script>
</head>
</html>

If the js file resides on a different server than the html file, a hostname can be specified:

   <script type="text/javascript" src="myjshost:/js/myscript.js"></script>
                                       --------
