Form-related name attributes enable convenient addressesing of name/value pairs for client-side data validation as well as server-side data processing actions.  Such actions may effect server state changes or trigger other html documents and related resources to be delivered back to the client.

On the client side, id attributes provide look up through js entry points such as getElementById and offer granular
access to specific form elements under programmatic control.
