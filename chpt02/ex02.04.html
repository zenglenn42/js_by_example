	What is the latest version of JS?  Where can you find this information?

	Places to find the latest javascript out in the wild:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Version_history
	https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp

	Why can't ecma script or js version be easily detected programmatically?
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47374678/how-to-detect-ecmascript-version

	Basically because browsers don't implement all the features of a given ecma release
	at one time.  So third party libraries like modernizr are useful for querying
	what features a given client browser supports.

	How to work around this developmentally?

	https://modernizr.com/
	Modernizr tells you what HTML, CSS and JavaScript features the userâ€™s browser has to offer.

	The idiom below uses the script language attribute to discern javascript version level.
