JavaScript statements enclosed in a set of curly braces:

   { statement1; statement2; ... ; statementn }

combine to form one logical statement often in the context
of looping constructs that include a multi-statement body:

   while (someCondition == true) 
   {
	statement1;
	statement2;
	..
   }
