	<title>Frame Me!</title>
	<!-- 
	This example seems a bit fragile in modern browswers (circa 2018).
	Certain idioms that attempt to address one frame from another
	such as: 

		parent.frames[i].document.bgColor=color 

	may throw exceptions:

		Uncaught DOMException: Blocked a frame with origin "null" 
		from accessing a cross-origin frame at setBgColor 
		(file:leftmenu.html:8:21) at <anonymous>:1:1

	I'm guessing this amounts to improved modern security configuration 
	that prevents cross-site scripting.  Frames are a fairly dated idiom
	to begin with so this wouldn't surprise me.

	Interestingly, updating the the location href indirectly seems well
	tolerated across various browsers on my laptop.

		parent.frames[i].location.href=url 

	Firefox seems to be the most forgiving browser for navigating these
	circa 2011 examples.  

	I coded up a simple alert to flag potential issues when running on non-Firefox
	browsers.

				if (lcUA.search(knownBrowsers[prop]) != -1) {
					detectedBrowser = knownBrowsers[prop];
					break;
				}
			}
			return detectedBrowser;
		}
		if (getBrowser(navigator.userAgent) != "firefox") {
			alert("You may encounter issues (DOMException) running this example on your browser. " +
				"It seems to run on Firefox, though.");
